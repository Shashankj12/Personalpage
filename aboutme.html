<div class="aboutme">
  <p>
    I am deeply curious about technology, mathematics, computers, programming, machine learning, and many other areas.
    I enjoy learning across disciplines and connecting the dots between theory and practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research experience spans topics like multi-objective optimization, compiler design, algorithm development, and mathematical modeling.
    I'm proficient in C++, with 6+ years of experience contributing to large compiler codebases.
    I‚Äôve implemented metaheuristic algorithms inside compilers and proposed both static and dynamic memory-allocation-based compiler optimizations with a multi-objective focus.
    I have multiple publications in these areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've extended compiler support for architectures like ARM Cortex-M0 and Leon3 processors.
    Alongside compilers, I‚Äôm also exploring topics in machine learning, data science, and systems programming.
    I‚Äôve completed several certifications and audited university-level courses in data science and machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    My love for mathematics led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Mathematical Modeling in Engineering, where I learned to apply mathematical tools to real-world problems.
    During my Master's thesis, I worked on control systems, multi-agent systems, and quantization, and my work was later published in a reputable IEEE journal.
  </p>

  <p>
    I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs in Mechanical Engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in engineering and the automotive domain.
    I also worked at Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India, which gave me practical insight into the automotive industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy diving into different technical topics, prototyping ideas, and exploring intersections of disciplines.
    I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek new challenges that let me grow intellectually and contribute meaningfully.
  </p>

  <!--<p>
    During my free time, I like to watch movies, animes, and different series, and I like to playing online games with friends.
    I have recently started playing snooker and tennis, which I am not good at still :)
    I would define myself as curios and nerd at heart!

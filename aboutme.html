<div class="aboutme">
  <p> I am interested in many things and try to learn them.... I am curious about latest technology, mathematics, computers, programming, machine learning, and many more things. </p>
  <p> I have worked on research topics related to multi-objective optimizations, compiler optimizations, algrithm development, and mathematical modelling.
      I am proficient in C++, with 6+ years of experience in coding in C++ in a large compiler codebase.
      I have worked on implementing metaheuristic algorithms within compilers, and proposed multi-objective dynamic and static memory allocation-based compiler optimizations.
      I have multiple publications in these topics.
      I have worked on extending the compiler support for ARM Cortex-M0 and Leon3 processor.
      I am also working on many other topics that interst me.
      I have done many certifications and auditted coures on topics related to data science and machine learing. </p>

  <p> My love for mathematics drew me towards my masters course.
      I did my masters in Mathematical modeling in engineering, which provided me with tools and knowleadge to bridge the world of mathematics with real-world engineering problems.
      I have also studied and worked in the field of control systems during my Master Thesis.
      I was able to publish my work during my Master Thesis in a reputable IEEE publication. </p>

  <p> During my Bachelors, I studied mechanical engineering, which laid my foundations in the world of engineering and automotive world.
      I worked in Mechedes Benz research and development India after my bachelor, which gave in insight in the automotive industry. </p>

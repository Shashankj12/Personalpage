  <p>
    I am deeply curious about <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>mathematics</strong>, <strong>computers</strong>, <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and many other areas.
    I enjoy learning across disciplines and connecting theory with practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research experience spans <strong>multi-objective optimization</strong>, <strong>compiler design</strong>, <strong>algorithm development</strong>, and <strong>mathematical modeling</strong>.
    I'm proficient in <strong>C++</strong> with 7+ years of experience contributing to a large-scale compiler codebase.
    I’ve implemented <strong>metaheuristic algorithms</strong> within the compiler and proposed both <strong>static</strong> and <strong>dynamic memory-allocation optimizations</strong> with a multi-objective focus.
    I also have multiple publications in these areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve extended compiler support for architectures like <strong>ARM Cortex-M0</strong> and <strong>Leon3</strong> processors.
    Alongside compilers, I explore <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>data science</strong>, and <strong>deep learning</strong>-related topics.
    I’ve completed several certifications and audited university-level courses in these fields.
  </p>

  <p>
    My love for mathematics led me to pursue a <strong>Master’s in Mathematical Modeling in Engineering</strong>, where I applied mathematical tools to real-world problems.
    During my thesis, I worked on <strong>control systems</strong>, <strong>multi-agent systems</strong>, and <strong>quantization</strong>, with work later published in a reputable <strong>IEEE journal</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I earned my <strong>Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering</strong>, which gave me a strong foundation in engineering and the <strong>automotive domain</strong>.
    I also worked at <strong>Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India</strong>, gaining practical insight into the automotive industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy exploring technical topics, prototyping ideas, and connecting disciplines.
    I believe in <strong>lifelong learning</strong> and constantly seek new challenges to grow intellectually and contribute meaningfully.
  </p>

    During my free time, I like to watch movies, animes, and different series, and I like to playing online games with friends.
    I have recently started playing snooker and tennis, which I am not good at still :)
    I would define myself as curios and nerd at heart!
